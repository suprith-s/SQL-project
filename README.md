# SQL-project
SQL project on BlinkIT Analysis:
Blinkit App Analysis is an SQL-based project that analyzes grocery delivery data to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. MySQL was used to write queries using joins, aggregate functions, and subqueries to extract meaningful insights. The analyzed data was then exported to Excel for visualization. This project demonstrates practical skills in SQL querying, data analysis, and reporting for e-commerce business insights.
